The leup (leupeptin) BGC of K. michiganensis KCTC 1686  was annotated according to [Li et al. (2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32609431/).
The functionality of this BGC was demonstrated by [Hamchand et al. (2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39406708/).

The PGAP-annotated GFF file available from GenBank (assembly GCF_000240325) was used as the source of coding sequences for a BLASTP database.
Bakta-annotated (v1.9.3, database 5.1 full) proteomes of 2716 genome sequences available from AllTheBacteria v1 [(Hunt et al., 2024)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.08.584059v3) were searched for the BGC, using >70 % coverage and >70 % identity thresholds to filter data.

- K. michiganensis, n=1298 (1176 BGC-positive, 90.6 %); K. oxytoca, n=865; K. grimontii, n=443 (4 BGC-positive, 0.9 %);
- K. pasteurii, n=82 (2 BGC-positive, 2.4 %);
- K. spallanzanii, n=12; Klebsiella taxon 3, n=7 (4 BGC-positive, 71.4 %);
- Klebsiella taxon 1, n=5; K. huaxiensis, n=4.

Only genomes encoding contiguous transporter–LeupA–LeupB–LeupC–LeupD sequences were annotated as having a complete leup BGC.
