# Spirotetronate forming cylases
===================================================

Diels-Alderase cyclases catalyze [4+2] cycloaddition reactions in natural product biosynthesis.
This is a model focused on the spirotetronate forming cylases.

The seed sequences here have been trimmed after alignment.

### Cutoff
In leave-one-out validation, the lowest scoring hit was 59.4.
However, there is a definite false positive within the MIBiG database scoring 64.3.
Due to this, a cutoff of 68 was chosen as a compromise.
